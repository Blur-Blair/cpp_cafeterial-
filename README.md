# cpp_cafeteria
** Week 4 project** 

## What It Does: 
This program simulates a Points of Sale (POS) system. 
 1. Item Count: It ask the user how many items they intend to buy.
 2. Price Accumulation: It loops through the specified number of item, asking for the price of each item.
 3. Automatic Discount: It checks if the total exceeds 100 Cedis.
    . If Yes: Applies a 10% discount
    . If NO : Charges the amount.
 4. Receipt Generation: Display the Subtotal, Discount amount, and Final Total formatted to 2 decimal places.

## Examples: 
. Enter the number of Items you bounght: 3
. Item 1 price : 50
. Item 2 price : 40
. Item 3 price : 30 
. Output: SubTotal: 120 
. Discount: 12
. Total: 108.00

## What I Am Learning: 
1. Input Validation.
2. Boolean Logic in loops.
3. Precision formatting.
